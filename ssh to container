To connect a docker container with ssh follow the steps..
Run a container(ubuntu server) with port mapping for ssh service to be run inside the container (ex: -p 2222:22 here the 2222 port can be used for connecting the container with different machine, 22 is default port mapping for ssh which is running inside the container
$ docker run -itd --name ubuntu_ssh --privileged=true -p 2222:22 ubuntu 
--privileged=true here mentioned is to restart the services inside the container automatically
2. Now open the container and install/conf the ssh service
$ docker exec -it cointainerid/containername /bin/bash (it opens the container's bash)
3.  Now we are in the container lets install the ssh service
apt-get update 
apt-get install ssh
To start the ssh
service ssh start
To check the ssh status
service --status-all
4. Now set the password to the root user of this container
passwd root
Enter your password
5.To add root permission in ssh config
First install vim in your container
apt-get install vim
now open
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Add this line to that file
PermitRootLogin yes
Now restart the ssh
service ssh restart
6. To save the container open a another terminal
$ docker commit containerid  containername
7. Now come back to the bash of the container
just type exit to come out of that container
And restart that container
$ docker restart containerid
And open the bash again by
$ docker exec -it cointainerid/containername /bin/bash 
Now start your ssh service  inside the container by
service ssh start
service --status-all 
[+] ssh means ssh is running
8. Now open a different machine and finnaly login the container through ssh
ssh root@publicip -p 2222  
It will prompt for password enter the password specified for root of container
-Here the public ip is the ip of your machine with the container running it
-we have specified the 2222 port because we have mapped that tcp to containers ssh service
